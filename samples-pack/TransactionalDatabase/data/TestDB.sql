Each request is made of one or several tasks (there can be thousands of tasks).<br>\nUpon reception of the request, all tasks are individually put into an execution queue.

The node, then, executes the task, returns the results to the server and waits for another task to execute.<br>\nWhen a task''s results are received, the server is notified and places the results in a list, in the same position as that of the corresponding task.

In the future, we intend to extend that architecture so as to scale up to millions of nodes.</li>\n<li>Robustness and fault tolerance: when a node dies, the server detects it, and resubmits the work it was doing, for pick-up by other nodes. Also, nodes can be dynamically added to, or removed from the framework, without any other cost whatsoever.</li>\n<li>No deployment is needed for your application code: the dynamic class loading mechanism in JPPF ensures that, not matter which nodes actually execute your tasks, they will find your code right where it is.

This is indeed a limitation, and it will probably not be addressed, however, not without breaking key features such as multiplatform portability, and dynamic and automatic application code deployment. This is a design decision, and we hope the widespread presence of Java in the IT world will compensate for it.</li>\n<li>Security: the dynamic code loading feature of JPPF has an inherent to security. We intend to address this issue, through a mechanism similar to that used for restricting the code in a Java applet. Actually, we intend to make it flexible and configurable, so that framework administrators can easily comply with their security requirements.</li>\n<li>Lack of failover: the JPPF server consitutes one obvious failure point. If it dies, the framework dies and nothing can be done. We will address this by enabling several servers to work together.
