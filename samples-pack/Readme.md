## About the samples pack

The samples pack is a set of small, self-contained applications that demonstrate the use of JPPF for real-life problems.
Each application can be built and run independantly.
The current applications in the samples pack are:

* [Generation of fractal images (Mandelbrot Set)](Fractals/Readme.md)
* [Protein and DNA sequence alignment](SequenceAlignment/Readme.md)
* [Distributed web crawler and search engine](WebSearchEngine/Readme.md)

* [Pluggable management beans sample](CustomMBeans/Readme.md)
* [Network data encryption sample](DataEncryption/Readme.md)
* [Customized server and node initialization sample](StartupClasses/Readme.md)
