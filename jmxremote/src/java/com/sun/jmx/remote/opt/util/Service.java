/**
 * EXTRACTED FROM sun.misc.Service A simple service-provider lookup mechanism.  * A <i>service</i> is a well-known
 * set of intjavax.management.remoteerfaces and (usually abstract) classes. A <i>service  * provider</i> is a specific
 * implementation of a service. The classes in a provider typically implement the interfaces and subclass the classes
 * defined in the service itself. Service providers may be installed in an implementation of the Java platform in the
 * form of extensions, that is, jar files placed into any of the usual extension directories. Providers may also be made
 * available by adding  * them to the applet or application class path or by some other platform-specific means.
 *
 * <p>In this lookup mechanism a service is represented by an interface or an abstract class. (A concrete class may
 * be used, but this is not recommended.) A provider of a given service contains one or more concrete classes that
 * extend this <i>service class</i> with data and code specific to the provider. This <i>provider class</i> will typically
 * not be the entire provider itself but rather a proxy that contains enough information to decide whether the provider
 * is able to satisfy a particular request together with code that can create the actual provider on demand. The details
 * of provider classes tend to be highly service-specific; no single class or interface could possibly unify them, so no
 * such class has been defined. The only requirement enforced here is that provider classes must have a zero-argument
 * constructor so that they may be instantiated during lookup.
 *
 * <p>A service provider identifies itself by placing a provider-configuration file in the resource directory <tt>META-INF/services</tt>.
 * The file's name should consist of the fully-qualified name of the abstract service class. The file should contain a
 * list of fully-qualified concrete provider-class names, one per line. Space and tab characters surrounding each name,
 * as well as blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is <tt>'#'</tt> (<tt>0x23</tt>); on each line all characters
 * following the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
 *
 * <p>If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one configuration file, or is named in the same configuration
 * file more than once, then the duplicates will be ignored. The configuration file naming a particular provider need not be
 * in the same jar file or other distribution unit as the provider itself. The provider must be accessible from the same class
 * loader that was initially queried to locate the configuration file; note that this is not necessarily the class loader that found the file.
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b> Suppose we have a service class named <tt>java.io.spi.CharCodec</tt>. It has two abstract methods:
 * <pre>
 * public abstract CharEncoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
 *
 * public abstract CharDecoder getDecoder(String encodingName);
 * </pre>
 * Each method returns an appropriate object or <tt>null</tt> if it cannot translate the given encoding. Typical <tt>CharCodec</tt> providers will support more than one encoding.
 *
 * <p>If <tt>sun.io.StandardCodec</tt> is a provider of the <tt>CharCodec</tt> service then its jar file would contain the file
 * <tt>META-INF/services/java.io.spi.CharCodec</tt>. This file would contain the single line:
 * <pre>sun.io.StandardCodec    # Standard codecs for the platform</pre>
 * To locate an encoder for a given encoding name, the internal I/O code would do something like this:
 * <pre>
 * CharEncoder getEncoder(String encodingName) {
 *   Iterator ps = Service.providers(CharCodec.class);
 *   while (ps.hasNext()) {
 *     CharCodec cc = (CharCodec) ps.next();
 *     CharEncoder ce = cc.getEncoder(encodingName);
 *     if (ce != null) return ce;
 *   }
 *   return null;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The provider-lookup mechanism always executes in the security context of the caller.
 * Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class from within a privileged security context.
