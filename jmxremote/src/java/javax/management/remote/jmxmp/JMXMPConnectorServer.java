/**
 * <p> A JMX API connector server that creates connections using the JMX Messaging Protocol over TCP.
 * Rather than instantiate this class directly, it is recommended to use the {@link JMXConnectorServerFactory}
 * with a {@link JMXServiceURL} that has protocol type <code>jmxmp</code>.
 *
 * <p>The address that the connector server should listen for connections on is specified with a
 * {@link JMXServiceURL} provided to the constructor. If the host is omitted from this address, the local
 * host is understood. If the port is omitted from this address, the connector server will listen on an
 * unspecified available port. The {@link #getAddress() getAddress} method can be used to discover which port it is.
 *
 * <p> If the local machine has more than one network interface, it is possible to listen for connections on all of
 * the interfaces, or on just one interface. By default, a connector server listens on all of the interfaces.
 * To listen on just one, specify the address of the interface in the <code>JMXServiceURL</code> and supply the
 * attribute {@link #SERVER_ADDRESS_WILDCARD} with the value <code>"false"</code> when constructing the connector server.
 *
 * <p>In addition to any protocol-specific authentication, this connector server can verify new connections and/or modify
 * the authenticated {@link javax.security.auth.Subject} by supplying a {@link JMXAuthenticator} using the attribute {@link #AUTHENTICATOR}.
 * The {@link JMXAuthenticator#authenticate authenticate} method will be called with a two-element <code>Object[]</code>.
 * The first element is a String that is the connection id of the new connection. The second element is either null or the
 * authenticated {@link javax.security.auth.Subject}. If the connection is accepted, the method returns the <code>Subject</code> to use
 * for received requests, or null if there is none. If the connection is rejected, the method throws an exception, typically {@link SecurityException}.
 * </p>
