<p>JPPF makes it easy to parallelize computationally intensive tasks and execute them on a Grid

<p>JPPF 3.1 brings new security features, load-balancing in the client, fork/join tasks execution and more.

What's new in JPPF 3.1

Security

JPPF 3.1 brings a new security layer by performing all <http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Configuring_SSL/TLS_communications>network communications through SSL/TLS</a>, providing data encryption, data integrity and certificate-based authentication.
Switching from plain to secure connections is as easy as toggling a single configuration flag. In this new context, a JPPF driver can serve both plain and secure connections, whereas clients and nodes attach via either.
Secure communication has been implemented on top of all connections used by JPPF: client to server, node to server, server to server and JMX remote connectors.

Management and monitoring

A new <http://www.jppf.org/screenshots.php?screenshot=Topology-GraphView.gif>graph view</a> of the grid topology has been added to the administration console
A new management API was added to <http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Server_management#Testing_an_execution_policy>test execution policies</a> against the current grid state
Jobs can now be cancelled directly from a standalone JPPF client or from the J2EE connector

Executor services

Job SLAs and metadata, along with task timeout and cancel handlers, can now be <http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=JPPF_Executor_Services#Configuring_jobs_and_tasks>dynamically configured</a> for tasks and jobs submitted from a JPPFExecutorService

Clients

The load balancing between local and remote execution is now <http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Client_and_administration_console_configuration#Load-balancing_in_the_client>fully configurable in the client</a>. The same algorithms and configuration parameters as for the server are available.

Nodes

A new node extension enables switching the node execution model to a <http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Fork/Join_thread_pool_in_the_nodes>local fork/join model</a>, using the JDK 7 APIs.
