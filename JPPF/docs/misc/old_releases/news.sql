In this new context, a JPPF driver can serve both plain and secure connections, whereas clients and nodes attach via either.\nSecure communication has been implemented on top of all connections used by JPPF: client to server, node to server, server to server and JMX remote connectors.\n\n<h3>Management and monitoring</h3>\n<ul class="samplesList">\n  <li>A new graph view of the grid topology has been added to the administration console</li>\n  <li>A new management API was added to <a href="http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Server_management#Testing_an_execution_policy">test execution policies</a> against the current grid state</li>\n  <li>Jobs can now be cancelled directly from a standalone JPPF client or from a JCA connection to the J2EE connector</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Executor services</h3>\n\n<p>Job SLAs and metadata, along with task timeout and cancel handlers, can now be <a href="http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=JPPF_Executor_Services#Configuring_jobs_and_tasks">dynamically configured</a> for tasks and jobs submitted from a JPPFExecutorService\n\n<h3>Clients</h3>\n\n<p>The load balancing between local and remote execution is now <a href="http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Client_and_administration_console_configuration#Load-balancing_in_the_client">fully configurable in the client</a>. The same algorithms and configuration parameters as for the server are available.\n\n<h3>Nodes</h3>\n\n<p>A new node extension enables switching the node execution model to a <a href="http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Fork/Join_thread_pool_in_the_nodes">local fork/join model</a>, using the JDK 7 APIs.\n\n<a name="features"></a>\n<h3>All implemented feature requests</h3>\n\n<ul class="samplesList">\n  <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2977885&group_id=135654&atid=733521">2977885 - Add SSL capabilities to JPPF</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3390360&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3390360 - Graph view of the grid topology (admin console)</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3442570&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3442570 - Enable timeout/onCancel for Callable/Runnable/POJO tasks</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3522495&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3522495 - Add management capabilities to J2EE connector</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3502395&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3502395 - Document runtime dependencies for JPPF components</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3488092&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3488092 - Determine if a job SLA matches any node before submission</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3481576&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3481576 - ForkJoin executor service</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3353566&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3353566 - Add JPPFClient.cancelJob(<jobID>)</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3285058&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3285058 - Enable configurable load-balancing on the client</li>\n	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3353578&group_id=135654&atid=733521">3353578 - JPPFTask timeout for local execution</li>\n</ul>'),
