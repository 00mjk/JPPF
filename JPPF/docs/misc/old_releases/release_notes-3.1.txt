JPPF makes it easy to parallelize computationally intensive tasks and execute them on a Grid.

This version brings new security features, load-balancing in the client, fork/join tasks execution and more.

What's new in JPPF 3.1:

Security

JPPF 3.1 brings a new security layer by performing all network communications through SSL/TLS, providing data encryption, data integrity and certificate-based authentication.
Switching from plain to secure connections is as easy as toggling a single configuration flag. In this new context, a JPPF driver can serve both plain and secure connections, whereas clients and nodes attach via either.
Secure communication has been implemented on top of all connections used by JPPF: client to server, node to server, server to server and JMX remote connectors.
Security configuration is documented here: http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Configuring_SSL/TLS_communications)

Management and monitoring

A new graph view of the grid topology has been added to the administration console
A new management policy was added to test execution policies against the current grid state
Jobs can now be cancelled directly from a standalone JPPF client or from a JCA connection to the J2EE connector

Executor services

Job SLAs and metadata, along with task timeout and cancel handlers, can now be dynamically configured for tasks and jobs submitted from a JPPFExecutorService
Documentation can be found here: http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=JPPF_Executor_Services#Configuring_jobs_and_tasks

Clients

The load balancing between local and remote execution is now fully configurable in the client. The same algorithms and configuration parameters as for the server are available.
Documentation can be found here: http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Client_and_administration_console_configuration#Load-balancing_in_the_client

Nodes

A new node extension enables switching the node execution model to a local fork/join model, using the JDK 7 APIs.
This feature is documented here: http://www.jppf.org/doc/v3/index.php?title=Fork/Join_thread_pool_in_the_nodes
