					<h3>Automatic Node Recovery</h3>
					We haven't addressed the issue of server crashes. We intend to have the nodes try to reconnect, for a limited period of time,
					before they give up and shutdown gracefully.<br>
					This is now implemented as of version 0.8.1<br>&nbsp;

					<h3>Automatic Client Recovery</h3>
					As for node recovery, we haven't addressed the issue of server crashes, with regards to the client applications.<br>
					We intend to have the client try to reconnect, then eventually resubmit the tasks that were being executed.<br>
					This feature is now implemented, as of version 0.8.2<br>&nbsp;

					<h3>Nodes Security Policy</h3>
					Currently, it is possible to run any Java code on a node. This is definitely a security risk, both for the code being run, and the host/network
					the code run on.<br>
					The short-term plan is to implement a Java security manager with restrictions on network and file I/O, plus other runtime restrictions
					(i.e. preventing from halting the JVM, that sort of things).<br>
					This feature is now implemented, as of version 0.9.0<br>&nbsp;

					<h3>Remote Monitoring and Administration</h3>
					We are planning on adding the following features :
					<ul>
						<li>ability to check the JPPF server's status and health</li>
						<li>operational statistics collection</li>
						<li>capacity to manage the server configuration and perform cleanup operations</li>
						<li>ability to perform scheduled / unscheduled server shutdowns</li>
					</ul>
					This change is now implemented, as of version 0.11.0<br>&nbsp;

					<h3>Scalability Improvements</h3>
					Today, the number of nodes the framework can handle is limited, by the number of TCP ports that can be opened on a single machine (the server).
					To address this, we'll have to upgrade the JPPF driver to a multi-server architecture. This will involve solving many issues, including
					an increase in communication complexity and potential performance pitfall. Ideally, we'd like to do this without changing the APIs used on the
					application layer or on the nodes layer. This is a major change and will take a long time to implement. We have no ETA yet.

					<h3>Nodes Running as Applets</h3>
					This is about enabling running one or several nodes within a web browser, in the form of Java applets.<br>
					The goal is to make it easy to start the nodes - as easy as clicking on a link.<br>
					Also, the plan is to attach a basic UI to the node, displaying execution statistic, resource consumption, and many other things.<br>
					We are planning to have this feature implemented in the next major version (1.0) at the latest.<br>
