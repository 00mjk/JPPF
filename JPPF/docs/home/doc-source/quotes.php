	<p align="justify">We have been using the JPPF since December 2007, and we have found the framework to be extremely powerful and easy to work with. The JPPF distributed framework has enabled us to create and maintain a network of over 140 processors for use in computationally intensive applications. Currently we use the framework to calculate predicted seismic wave travel times through global 3-D Earth models. As with any tool as complex as a distributed computing package (JPPF), understanding the multitude of parameter setting options can be challenging. The very responsive JPPF support team and user forums have been a crucial resource for answering our system related configuration issues. JPPF is a very powerful package!

	<p align="justify">We use JPPF on small clusters with up to 20 nodes to handle computationally expensive, non-recurring tasks that include statistical analysis, basic linguistic analysis, genetic algorithms for neural networks and classifier training. Not only is JPPF easy to setup and use, but the task-oriented design is very powerful yet approachable and easy to understand. This ease of use is JPPF's greatest strength because it effectively allows us to utilize our existing code, processes and algorithms in a distributed environment with minimal effort and time. The ability to adapt our existing technology without having to redesign or rethink entire processes is fantastic. In addition, the forums have provided incredibly fast and useful assistance when necessary. Overall, we have found JPPF to be a very practical and valuable tool in our toolbox.
