<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>The goal of this quick start tutorial is to show you how to write a full JPPF application and execute it in your environment.
It is delivered as a full self-contained application with its own scripts for building and running it.

<h2>1.1 What you will learn</h2>
<ul>
	<li>An overview of the JPPF capabilities</li>
	<li>How to write a fully functional JPPF application</li>
	<li>How to integrate your existing code with JPPF</li>
	<li>How to run a sample JPPF application</li>
	<li>How to find further information and support for advanced use of JPPF</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2 Organization of this guide</h2>
<p>The code in this tutorial can be viewed, built and executed in 3 ways:
<ul>
	<li>From the command line: Windows and Linux scripts are included for executing the application.
	To build from the source, you will need to use one of the other 2 ways.</li>
	<li>As an <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a> project, using the provided build.xml build file. The targets are "build" for building the code, and "run.helloworld" to execute the application.</li>
	<li>As an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> project: simply import this Quick Start Guide as an Eclipse project (Eclipse 3.4 or later required), and use the provided launch configuration to run it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.3 Prerequisites</h2>
To effectively run through this tutorial, you should have the following:
<ul>
	<li>Java 1.5 or later installed in your environment</li>
	<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> installed in your environment</li>
	<li>The JPPF package containing the present tutorial</li>
